No-HDD-Spindown
===============

Simple tool that makes frequent dummy writes on HDD(s) to keep them from spinning down

Hello,
I created this customised tool for my own use some time ago because none of the similar tools that are available for download make dummy writes frequently enough and my external hard drive was still spinning down after some 5 secs of inactivity. So I have this tool which can work with up to 4 hard drives and write as often as once every second.

Best regards
